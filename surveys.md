# Surveys


We have a short survey for workshop attendees (10 mins or less) that would help us understand your perspective on CI: [<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc474NTrWAPV3TylWqrnWhDtYxyfr-axtKCNYAoOy7sFCcchQ/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&usp=mail_form_link">link</a>]

we have an even shorter survey (5mins or less), for the CI people working in your facilities, Centers, and projects. We would like to understand what (if any) community resources your CI staff is using and contributing to, and whether they feel part of the CI community: [<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeY6wmq-oFJKZTaE9rHwMBMC89DVvpVgpI3xTCglcmB7-QbUw/viewform?vc=0&c=0&w=1&usp=mail_form_link">link</a>]
